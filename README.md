# Integrating Workflows and change management in the ci/cd process
Creating scripts to run data pipelines, database inserts, file transfers and all other orchestration requirements, brings about the need to  manage, automate and structure all of these scripts. All too often, businesses don't have visibility as to what point processing is at or when things are due to finish.
Throw agile into the equation and although it is amazingly fast, visibility takes another step away from the forefront. 
Having the ability to build workflows in code and have them as part of the SDLC as well as beinng able to see them run from a web ui is the perfect world for workload orchestration.

This repo contains some of the artefacts used to showcase these unique abilities.
